## Description

_The index page descibes the curriculum at Epicodus. Also, a link is provided to see a list of my favorite things. A complimentary photo of Nyan Cat is provided for entertainment. Once you enter the favorite things page more information is displayed about me, my friends, and my family. Photos are not accurate portrayals of my parents and page formatting is unpleasant._
