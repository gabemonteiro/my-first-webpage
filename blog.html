<center><p class="intro"> Here we see the dynamic duo of Cooper (The bigger one) and Ash (The one flopped on his side) longingly sitting near the screen door.</p></center>
<p>Shortly after this photo was taken a neighbors cat walked along the side of the house and across the door. Immediatley causing a flight response for these two. Causing what we call a "burnout" where their fur covered paws cannot recieve traction on the hardwood floor causing the sound of repeated nail scratching as they attempt to flee.</p>
<p>Other things that TERRIFY them</p>

      <li>Sneezes</li>
      <li>Coughs</li>
      <li>Yelling on the TV</li>
      <li>& Stretching with your arms above your head</li>
    </ul>
